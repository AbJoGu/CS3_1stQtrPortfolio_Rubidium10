        <h2> Reflections for the End of Quarter 1 </h2> <br>
        <ol>
          <li> Repeating statements/loops: The concepts and just the coding part of loops is simple and easy to understand.
               Syntax was similar to C++ which we learned in Grade 8 </li>
          <li> Arithmetic Operators: One of the simplest concepts for me. Just some + and - symbols. <li>
          <li> User interface: Generally easy syntax to memorize. Process behind it makes sense <li>
          <li> GitHub Management: GitHub has a very clear UI. Everything is labeled and their uses are immediately apparent </li>
          <li> JavaScript Coding and Syntax: JavaScript is very understandbale. Copies human language, being a high-level programming language </li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
            <li> VSCode Management: VSCode management requires some knowledge of .bash. The reqirement of Live Server and other foreign applications </li>
            <li> HTML Coding: HTML seems like a low-level programming language. Syntax is foreign and had=rd to understand. </li>

        </ol>
